# Machine Learning Notebook - for competition Bitfest Datathon 2025

This repository contains the Jupyter Notebook developed for the [Bitfest Datathon 2025 Kaggle competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bitfest-datathon-2025/overview). The competition involves predictive modeling on a dataset provided during the datathon.

## Overview

This notebook performs the following tasks:

- **Data Exploration:** Visualizing and understanding the dataset.
- **Preprocessing:** Cleaning and transforming data for machine learning.
- **Feature Engineering:** Creating and selecting features to improve model performance.
- **Model Training:** Applying machine learning algorithms to make predictions.
- **Evaluation:** Assessing model performance using competition metrics.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
- Required Python libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy
  - scikit-learn
  - matplotlib
  - seaborn
  - [any additional libraries used in the notebook]

You can install all dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Dataset

The dataset for this competition can be accessed directly on Kaggle: [Bitfest Datathon 2025 Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bitfest-datathon-2025/data). Ensure you download the dataset and place it in the appropriate folder structure as expected by the notebook.

## Notebook Contents
